ePiphany-for-Procurenet
Overview

ePiphany-for-Procurenet is a robust tool designed to manage product updates in a WooCommerce store. This script places a special emphasis on enhancing SEO, ensuring efficient error handling, and optimizing the update process through concurrent operations.
Features
Database Connection & Tables Creation

    The script establishes a connection with a PostgreSQL database.
    Automatically creates tables (updated_products and failed_products) if they don't already exist.
    These tables track products that have either been successfully updated or have encountered issues during the process.

User-friendly Menu Interface

    Incorporates an interactive console interface using the main_menu() function.
    Central and intuitive for users, guiding them through various tasks.

OpenAI API Integration for Product Descriptions

    Employs the OpenAI API to improve product descriptions.
    Primarily uses the generate_seo_content() function. This function enriches SEO content, although the exact API call to OpenAI is abstracted in the given description.

WooCommerce API Integration

    Integrates seamlessly with the WooCommerce REST API.
    Retrieves and updates product details efficiently using the aiohttp library for asynchronous GET and PUT requests.

Concurrency with Asyncio

    Leverages Python's asyncio library for enhancing performance.
    Functions such as update_one_product(), update_category_products(), and update_entire_catalog() use asynchronous programming to process multiple products concurrently.

Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

    Advanced error-handling mechanisms designed around aiohttp and asyncio.
    In the event of a product update failure, the script:
        Logs the incident.
        Saves details of the failed product to the failed_products table.
        Provides an option to the user for retrying updates on these products.

Logging

    Comprehensive logging functionality included.
    Logs every significant action (updates, failures, etc.) to a local file, facilitating debugging, progress tracking, and ensuring operational transparency.

Pagination Handling

    Efficiently handles pagination when retrieving product data from WooCommerce.
    Guarantees all products are fetched, even if they are spread across multiple pages on the WooCommerce API endpoint.
